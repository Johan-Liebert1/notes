TODO:

1. update stage
2. write grub user.cfg as staged while updating

## The WHY of integrating composefs into bootc

ostree sotres things in an object store with the file hash being the file data + file metadata 

so let's say depl1 has bash, and depl2 has bash, both have the same content but have different metdata, then we can't hardlink one file as the metdata are different.
We'll need double the space just because the metdata is different


If say depl-old has a vulnerable sudo and depl-new has a non vuln sudo, we can still access the setuid 0 sudo from depl-old even if depl-new is mounted, as they're hard links.

But with composfs we only store a single file and all the metadata is in Erofs file, you need to be root to mount and use the vuln sudo
